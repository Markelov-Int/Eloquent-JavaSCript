I'm trying to continually increase the size of the balloon emoji 10px when a user pushes the up arrow as well as decrease size by 10px with down arrow on keypad.

I've been trying to set:

let size = para.style.fontSize;
in order to get a variable for the size and then adjust that value by adding +/- 10px in my function. However, I've tried this method and it seems as if you can not set:

para.style.fontSize = size +10;
Does anybody have any suggestions to get this to work?

Note: I have not included the size variable in the code below as I found it does not work.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Title of the document</title>
  <style>
    p {
      font-size: 50px;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <p>ðŸŽˆ</p>

  <script>
    let para = document.querySelector('p');


    window.addEventListener("keydown", e => {
    if (e.key == "ArrowUp") {
      para.style.fontSize = '60px';
    } else {
      para.style.fontSize = '40px';
    }
  });



  </script>

</body>
